                We are software developers on a mission to assist members of the community to monitor
                and preserve one of earth’s most precious resources: our water.  We need water for everything; it is essential to sustain life,
                yet safe clean water is often taken for granted.  It is estimated that only 3.5 percent
                of earth’s water is suitable for drinking. Currently almost 1.2 billion people live in
                areas without sufficient water.
